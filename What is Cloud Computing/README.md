## -> What is "Cloud Computing"?

It is simply computing the several resources of typical systems like CPU,Processor,RAM,database,softwares,Network Connectivities etc. over the "cloud"(Internet).

## -> Vendors of cloud computing:

Vendors are nothing but those who provide these computing features over the cloud. 
 
 -for example
 
   -> Amazon- AWS (Amazon Web Service)
   
   -> Microsoft- Azure
   
   -> Google - GCP (Google Cloud Platform)  
   
   ->Oracle
   
   ->IBM
   
   ->Alibaba etc.

# -> What are the "Types of CLOUD"?

**1. Private Cloud-**
	Cloud computing resources used by organisation i.e. it is owned by organisation. In private cloud services are maintenances on a private network.
	
**2. Public Cloud-**
	Anyone can use the cloud computing resources. Different vendors are present in the market to provide the services on rent basis. In public cloud hardware, software like all services are owned and managed by cloud provider.
	
**3. Hybrid Cloud-**
	It consist of private and public both cloud services.
	
## -> What is AWS?

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the platform which provides the computing resources for user on the basis of “Pay as you Go model”.
Services for example- ec2, s3, IAM, RDS, etc.

## -> Advantages of AWS-
•Pay as you go model- 
It charges for resources only when you are using the resources.

•On demand scale-up and scale-down-
	We can increase the size of resources (RAM, hard disk etc.) and we have to pay for only those scalable resources.
	
•Fast development and deployment-
	Earlier server was taken on lease for fixed locking period but in AWS this is not such  a criteria.
	
•Outsourced management-
	AWS handles Administration, maintenance, provides reliability, security etc.
	
•Low cost

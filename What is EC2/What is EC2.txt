Wht is EC2 in AWS?

-> Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is the virtual computing environment(instance) on the AWS.
-> we can also say EC2 is nothing but the virtual machine(Computer) which can be configured by user depends on its own need of machine specifaction.
-> that means we have various configuration options like OS,CPU,RAM,Storage(Volume),networking facility for our EC2 instance.
-> We can change the parameter or specification of EC2 by simply changing the configuration i.e. called "Scalability" which is major advantage of EC2.

->AWS provide us these EC2 instances on rent. 

Features of EC2

-> We can apply scalability on existng EC2 instance .
example- Suppose I configured my EC2 instance with 2GB RAM size wich is sufficient for my workspace. But suppose the case where I have to work with some larger software application for some period of time, Then I'll simply make it change in configuration of existing ec2 instance. And after done required application I can simply change it again to my previous one configuration.  

-> Pay-as-you-go-model- AWS will be charged on only for those instances which you used. And you have to pay based on how many hours you used the instance services. 

->The process of making instace is very simple and user friendly anyone can do it's own.

->We can make multiple instances on same account.

->We can access these instances anytime and anywhere.
